# GraphArt

## 👋 Hi there!

Thanks for passing by!

This repo is a little experiment I did using a Python script I found here:  
👉 [Tukzon/GitHubGraphDraw](https://github.com/Tukzon/GitHubGraphDraw)  
It lets you draw words right into your GitHub contribution graph — pixel by pixel, commit by commit — just to make my dusty GitHub look a little more interesting 🌱

My profile looked kind of quiet before, but that's only because I was working in private and company repositories.  
Most of my code lived in places I couldn’t show you… until now.

This year, I decided to have a little fun and give this profile a proper glow-up ✨  
**Because if you’re here reading this — you deserve more than just a blank graph.**
