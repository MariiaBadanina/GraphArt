# GraphArt

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Thanks for passing by!

This repo is a little experiment I did using a Python script I found here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Tukzon/GitHubGraphDraw](https://github.com/Tukzon/GitHubGraphDraw)  
It lets you draw words right into your GitHub contribution graph â€” pixel by pixel, commit by commit
just to make my dusty GitHub look a little more interesting ðŸŒ±

My profile looked kind of quiet before, but that's only because I was working in private and company repositories.  
Most of my code lived in places I couldnâ€™t show youâ€¦ until now.

This year, I decided to have a little fun and give this profile a proper glow-up âœ¨  
Because if you're here reading this â€” you deserve something a bit more _me_.

â€” Masha ðŸŒ¿
